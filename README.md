Introduction
Machine translation is the task of automatically converting text from one language into another. The Transformer model, introduced in the paper "Attention is All You Need" by Vaswani et al., has shown state-of-the-art performance in various natural language processing tasks, including machine translation.

This project implements a Transformer model using TensorFlow and TensorFlow Datasets for translating English sentences into Tamil.


pip install tensorflow tensorflow-datasets numpy matplotlib
Usage
To use the Transformer model for translating English sentences to Tamil, follow these steps:

Prepare your dataset: Make sure you have English sentences and their corresponding Tamil translations. You can use any suitable dataset or provide your own data.

Preprocess the data: The provided code includes functions for tokenizing and preprocessing the input data. Make sure to adjust the paths to your data files accordingly.

Train the model: Execute the training loop provided in the code. You can adjust hyperparameters such as the number of layers, hidden units, and learning rate to optimize the model for your dataset.

Evaluate the model: Once trained, you can evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as loss and accuracy.

Training
To train the Transformer model, execute the provided training loop. Here's an example of how to run the training:

python

      EPOCHS = 10
      for epoch in range(EPOCHS):
      train_loss.reset_states()
      train_accuracy.reset_states()

      for (batch, (inp, tar)) in enumerate(train_dataset):
        train_step(inp, tar)

      if batch % 50 == 0:
            print(f'Epoch {epoch + 1} Batch {batch} Loss {train_loss.result():.4f} Accuracy {train_accuracy.result():.4f}')

      print(f'Epoch {epoch + 1} Loss {train_loss.result():.4f} Accuracy {train_accuracy.result():.4f}')
